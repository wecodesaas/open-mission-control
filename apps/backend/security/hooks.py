    Pre-tool-use hook that validates bash commands using dynamic allowlist.

    This is the main security enforcement point. It:
    1. Validates tool_input structure (must be dict with 'command' key)
    2. Extracts command names from the command string
    3. Checks each command against the project's security profile
    4. Runs additional validation for sensitive commands
    5. Blocks disallowed commands with clear error messages
