# Auto Claude UI Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and set your values

# ============================================
# DEBUG SETTINGS
# ============================================

# Enable debug logging across the entire application
# When enabled, you'll see detailed console logs for:
# - Ideation and roadmap generation
# - IPC communication between processes
# - Store state updates
# - Changelog generation and project initialization
# - GitHub OAuth flow
# Usage: Set to 'true' before starting the app
# DEBUG=true

# Enable debug logging for the auto-updater only
# Shows detailed information about app update checks and downloads
# DEBUG_UPDATER=true

# ============================================
# SENTRY ERROR REPORTING
# ============================================

# Sentry DSN for anonymous error reporting
# If not set, error reporting is completely disabled (safe for forks)
#
# For official builds: Set in CI/CD secrets
# For local testing: Uncomment and add your DSN
#
# SENTRY_DSN=https://your-dsn@sentry.io/project-id

# Force enable Sentry in development mode (normally disabled in dev)
# Only works when SENTRY_DSN is also set
# SENTRY_DEV=true

# Trace sample rate for performance monitoring (0.0 to 1.0)
# Controls what percentage of transactions are sampled
# Default: 0.1 (10%) in production, 0 in development
# Set to 0 to disable performance monitoring entirely
# SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1

# Profile sample rate for profiling (0.0 to 1.0)
# Controls what percentage of sampled transactions include profiling data
# Default: 0.1 (10%) in production, 0 in development
# Set to 0 to disable profiling entirely
# SENTRY_PROFILES_SAMPLE_RATE=0.1

# ============================================
# HOW TO USE
# ============================================

# Option 1: Set in your shell before starting the app
#   DEBUG=true npm start
#
# Option 2: Export in your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)
#   export DEBUG=true
#
# Option 3: Create a .env file in this directory (auto-claude-ui/)
#   Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
#   Then uncomment and set the variables you need
#
# Note: The Electron app will read these from process.env
# The Python backend (auto-claude) has its own .env file

# ============================================
# DEVELOPMENT

# Node environment (automatically set by npm scripts)
# NODE_ENV=development
