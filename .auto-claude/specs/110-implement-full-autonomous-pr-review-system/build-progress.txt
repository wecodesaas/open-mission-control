=== AUTO-BUILD PROGRESS ===

Project: Full Autonomous PR Review System
Workspace: .auto-claude/specs/110-implement-full-autonomous-pr-review-system/
Started: 2026-01-08

Workflow Type: feature
Rationale: Major cross-service feature (6-8 weeks) spanning backend Python and frontend TypeScript/Electron. Introduces new architectural patterns (circuit breakers, state persistence, security layer), extends the core state machine, and requires security-critical components.

Session 1 (Planner):
- Created implementation_plan.json
- Phases: 8
- Total subtasks: 33
- Created init.sh
- Created build-progress.txt

Phase Summary:
- Phase 0 (Foundation): 4 subtasks - State machine + audit events (no dependencies)
- Phase 1 (Security Infrastructure): 3 subtasks - InputSanitizer, PermissionManager, BotVerifier (depends on Phase 0)
- Phase 2 (Backend Infrastructure): 6 subtasks - State persistence, check waiter, fixer agent, orchestrator (depends on Phase 1)
- Phase 3 (Backend Integration): 5 subtasks - State adapter, IPC handlers, workflow integration (depends on Phase 2)
- Phase 4 (Frontend UI): 6 subtasks - Hook, component, toggle, i18n (depends on Phase 3)
- Phase 5 (Observability): 3 subtasks - Structured logging, telemetry, health check (depends on Phase 2, parallel with Phase 4)
- Phase 6 (Testing): 5 subtasks - Unit tests, edge cases (depends on Phases 4+5)
- Phase 7 (Integration): 2 subtasks - E2E tests, security audit (depends on Phase 6)

Services Involved:
- backend: Primary service - State machine, orchestrator, security layer, agent
- frontend: Integration service - IPC handlers, React components, i18n

Frontend:
  - apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/github-issues/hooks/useAutoPRReview.ts
  - apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/github-issues/components/AutoPRReviewProgressCard.tsx
Tests:
  - tests/test_input_sanitizer.py

  - tests/test_pr_check_waiter.py
  - tests/test_auto_pr_review_orchestrator.py
  - tests/test_pr_review_edge_cases.py
  - tests/integration/test_full_pr_review_flow.py

Files to Modify (12):
Backend:
  - apps/backend/runners/github/lifecycle.py (add states)
  - apps/backend/runners/github/audit.py (add events)
  - apps/backend/requirements.txt (add dependencies)
  - apps/backend/agents/tools_pkg/models.py (register pr_fixer)
  - apps/backend/runners/github/services/autofix_processor.py (connect orchestrator)
Frontend:
  - apps/frontend/src/shared/constants.ts (IPC channels)
  - apps/frontend/src/preload/api/modules/github-api.ts (types)
  - apps/frontend/src/main/ipc-handlers/github/autofix-handlers.ts (handlers)
  - apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/github-issues/components/IssueListHeader.tsx (toggle)
  - apps/frontend/src/renderer/components/github-issues/types.ts (interfaces)
  - apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/en/github.json (i18n)
  - apps/frontend/src/shared/i18n/locales/fr/github.json (i18n)

Parallelism Analysis:
- Max parallel phases: 2
- Recommended workers: 1 (sequential execution recommended due to complex dependencies)
- Parallel groups: Phase 4 (Frontend UI) and Phase 5 (Observability) can run in parallel

Critical Constraints:
- NEVER auto-merge - human approval required at final state
- Security-first: InputSanitizer and PermissionManager block orchestrator
- State machine changes in lifecycle.py block all downstream phases
- All user-facing text must use i18n translation keys

Verification Strategy:
- Risk level: HIGH
- Unit tests required for all new components
- Security scanning required (prompt injection, authorization bypass)
- Integration tests for full PR review flow
- E2E tests for frontend interactions

=== STARTUP COMMAND ===

=== SESSION 2 (Coder) ===

Started: 2026-01-08T23:13:00Z

Phase 0 (Foundation) - subtask-0-1 and subtask-0-2:
- Added 3 new PR review states to IssueLifecycleState enum:
  - PR_AWAITING_CHECKS = "pr_awaiting_checks" (PR waiting for CI checks)
  - PR_FIXING = "pr_fixing" (Agent fixing issues found during review)
  - PR_READY_TO_MERGE = "pr_ready_to_merge" (PR approved, checks passed)
- Added valid transitions in VALID_TRANSITIONS dict for new states:
  - PR_CREATED → PR_AWAITING_CHECKS, PR_REVIEWING
  - PR_AWAITING_CHECKS → PR_REVIEWING, BUILD_FAILED
  - PR_CHANGES_REQUESTED → PR_FIXING
  - PR_FIXING → PR_AWAITING_CHECKS, BUILD_FAILED
  - PR_APPROVED → PR_READY_TO_MERGE, MERGED
  - PR_READY_TO_MERGE → MERGED
- File modified: apps/backend/runners/github/lifecycle.py
- Verification: Python syntax check passed, grep confirms new states present
- Committed: auto-claude: subtask-0-1 - Add new PR review states to IssueLifecycleState enum

Remaining Phase 0 subtasks:
- subtask-0-3: Add 7 new audit events
- subtask-0-4: Add backend dependencies to requirements.txt
